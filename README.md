## **Python Basics**

### **1. Variables and Data Types**  
Define variables without specifying their type:  
```python
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 25        # Integer
height = 5.5    # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

### **2. Conditional Statements**  
Python supports `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making:  
```python
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### **3. Loops**  
Use loops for repetitive tasks:  
- **For Loop:**  
  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)  # Outputs 0 to 4
  ```
- **While Loop:**  
  ```python
  count = 0
  while count < 5:
      print(count)
      count += 1
  ```

## **Key Python Features**

### **1. Functions**  
Reusable blocks of code:  
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### **2. Lists and Dictionaries**  
- **List:**  
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
  ```
- **Dictionary:**  
  ```python
  student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
  print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
  ```

### **3. File Handling**  
Reading and writing files:  
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, File!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## **Practical Python Example: FizzBuzz**  
A classic beginner exercise:  
```python
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```
